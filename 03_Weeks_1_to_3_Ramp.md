# Weeks 1–3: Course Ramp-Up

## Week 1 – Systems, Not Magic

**Focus:** Framing AI as a system rather than a black box

- Introduction to the course philosophy and delivery stack
- What AI is (and is not) in creative practice
- Overview of Max for Live as a systems environment
- Live demonstration: simple rule-based automation vs generative behaviour

**Practical:**
- Install and verify Ableton Live + Max for Live environment
- Explore an existing Max for Live device and trace signal/control flow

**Outcome:**
Students can describe a creative tool in terms of inputs, transformations, and outputs.

## Week 2 – Control, Constraints, and Augmentation

**Focus:** Agency and constraint in AI-assisted systems

- Parameters, modulation, and decision spaces
- Introduction to basic ML concepts (training vs inference, determinism vs probability)
- Examples of AI as helper, filter, or provocateur

**Practical:**
- Modify a Max for Live device to introduce constrained variability
- Experiment with automation that responds to performer input

**Outcome:**
Students can design systems that behave *with* the performer, not instead of them.

## Week 3 – Collaboration and Traceability

**Focus:** Creative work as a shared, versioned system

- Introduction to GitHub workflows for creative projects
- Reading pull requests as creative conversations
- AI concierge walkthrough: summarising changes and system state

**Practical:**
- Fork or branch the course repository
- Submit a small modification via pull request with reflection notes

**Outcome:**
Students understand how creative systems evolve collaboratively and how AI can support—not replace—human decision-making.
