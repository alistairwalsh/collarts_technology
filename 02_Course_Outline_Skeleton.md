# Course Outline Skeleton

## Course Title
AI-Augmented Creative Systems (Working Title)

## Course Description
A practice-led investigation into how artificial intelligence can be integrated into creative workflows using Max for Live, networked collaboration tools, and critical reflection. Students design, prototype, and evaluate AI-assisted creative systems for music, performance, and media production.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Design custom Max for Live devices that integrate rule-based logic and/or machine learning components.
- Evaluate the creative and ethical implications of AI-augmented workflows.
- Collaborate using version-controlled creative repositories.
- Communicate technical and artistic intent through documentation and critique.

## Assessment Overview (Indicative)

- **Project 1 – System Sketch** (individual): exploratory Max for Live device + reflection
- **Project 2 – Collaborative Tool** (group): shared device or workflow submitted via GitHub
- **Project 3 – Final System & Critique** (individual or group): deployable creative system + written or recorded reflection

## Teaching Modes

- Studio workshops (Max for Live + AI concepts)
- Live critiques and demonstrations
- Online collaboration via GitHub and Discord
- AI-mediated feedback and system observability
