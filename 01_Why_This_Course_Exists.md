# Why This Course Exists

Creative industries are already saturated with AI tools, but most practitioners encounter them as opaque services rather than systems they can interrogate, adapt, or resist. This course exists to shift students from *users* of AI tools to *authors of creative systems*.

At Collarts, students are already fluent in sound, performance, design, and storytelling. What is missing is not creativity, but **technical literacy around the tools now shaping creative labour**. Machine learning models increasingly influence how music is generated, mixed, distributed, and monetised. Without an understanding of how these systems operate, creative practitioners risk losing agency over their own workflows.

This course positions AI not as a replacement for creative practice, but as an *instrument*: something that can be patched, constrained, repurposed, or rejected. By anchoring AI exploration inside Max for Live—an environment built on signal flow, control structures, and experimentation—students learn how intelligent systems actually behave under creative pressure.

Equally important, the course foregrounds critical literacy. Students are encouraged to question when AI adds value, when it degrades authorship, and how automation reshapes power inside creative industries. The aim is not to produce AI specialists, but **resilient, systems-literate artists** who can navigate emerging technologies without surrendering creative intent.
